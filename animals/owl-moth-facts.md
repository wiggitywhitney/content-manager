# Owl Moth Facts

Owl moths (also called owl butterflies or *Caligo* species) are large butterflies whose underwings feature enormous eyespots that mimic owl eyes - one of nature's most dramatic examples of mimicry!

## The Owl Eye Illusion

- **Giant Eyespots**: Eyespots on the underwing can be 2-3 inches in diameter, complete with "pupil" and "iris"
- **Perfect Mimicry**: The pattern closely resembles the eyes of owls or other large predators
- **Startling Defense**: When wings suddenly open, the eyespots startle predators into thinking they're facing a much larger animal
- **Dual Purpose**: May also redirect attacks away from vital body parts toward the wings

## Not Actually Moths

- **Misleading Name**: Despite the name "owl moth," they're actually butterflies (family Nymphalidae)
- **Owl Butterfly**: More accurate name, though "owl moth" is commonly used
- **Large Size**: Wingspan can reach 5-8 inches, making them among the largest butterflies
- **Tropical Species**: Native to Central and South American rainforests

## Behavior & Habitat

- **Crepuscular**: Most active at dawn and dusk when real owls are also active
- **Forest Floor**: Often rest on tree trunks with wings closed, blending in with bark
- **Rotting Fruit Diet**: Feed primarily on fermenting fruit rather than nectar
- **Short Lifespan**: Adults live only a few weeks, just long enough to reproduce

## Defense Strategy

The eyespots work through:
- **Intimidation**: Predators hesitate when confronted with what appears to be owl eyes
- **Deflection**: Birds may attack the "eyes" instead of the butterfly's body
- **Confusion**: The sudden appearance of large eyes disrupts predator attack sequences
- **Size Exaggeration**: Makes the butterfly appear much larger than it actually is

These remarkable butterflies are a prime example of evolutionary mimicry and defensive adaptation!
