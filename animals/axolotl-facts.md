# Axolotl Facts

Axolotls are unique amphibians native to Mexico, famous for their adorable appearance and extraordinary regenerative abilities. They're sometimes called "walking fish" but are actually salamanders!

## The Peter Pan of Salamanders

- **Neoteny**: Axolotls exhibit neoteny - they reach adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis
- **Permanent Gills**: Keep their feathery external gills throughout their entire life
- **Aquatic Forever**: Unlike most salamanders, they remain fully aquatic and never develop lungs
- **Can Transform**: Under rare circumstances (stress or hormones), they can metamorphose into terrestrial form

## Incredible Regeneration

- **Lost Limbs**: Can regrow entire limbs, complete with bones, muscles, and nerves
- **Organs**: Can regenerate heart, lungs, ovaries, and even parts of their brain
- **Spinal Cord**: One of the few vertebrates that can regenerate spinal cord tissue
- **No Scarring**: Regenerated tissue is identical to the original, with no scar tissue
- **Multiple Times**: Can regenerate the same body part multiple times throughout their life

## Appearance

- **Size**: Grow 6-18 inches long
- **Colors**: Wild type is dark brown/black, but captive breeding has produced pink, white, golden, and other colors
- **Smile**: Permanent "smile" due to the shape of their mouth
- **Frilly Gills**: Six feathery gill stalks on each side of their head

## Conservation Status

Critically endangered in the wild due to habitat loss in their native Lake Xochimilco near Mexico City. Ironically, they're abundant in captivity as popular pets and research subjects.
