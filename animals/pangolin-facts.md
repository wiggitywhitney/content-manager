# Pangolin Facts

Pangolins are the world's only truly scaly mammals and the most trafficked mammals on Earth. These unique creatures are critically endangered and desperately need protection.

## Unique Armor

- **Keratin Scales**: Covered in overlapping scales made of keratin (same material as human fingernails)
- **20% of Body Weight**: Their scales make up about 20% of their total weight
- **Protective Ball**: When threatened, they curl into a tight ball that's nearly impenetrable
- **Sharp Edges**: The scales have sharp edges that cut predators' mouths
- **Growing Scales**: Scales continuously grow and are sharpened by digging and climbing

## Specialized Diet

- **Ant and Termite Specialists**: Exclusively eat ants and termites
- **No Teeth**: Completely toothless, relying on their long, sticky tongue
- **Tongue Length**: Tongue can be longer than their entire body when fully extended (up to 16 inches)
- **Stomach Grinding**: Swallow small stones to help grind up insects in their stomach
- **Huge Appetite**: Can consume 70 million insects per year

## Adaptations

- **Powerful Claws**: Dig into termite mounds and ant nests with enormous front claws
- **Sealed Ears and Nostrils**: Can close them to protect against insect bites
- **Poor Eyesight**: Rely heavily on smell to find food
- **Prehensile Tail**: Some species use their tail as a fifth limb for climbing

## Eight Species

Four species in Asia, four in Africa. All eight species are threatened with extinction, with some classified as critically endangered.

## Conservation Crisis

Pangolins are the most illegally trafficked mammals in the world. Hunted for their meat (considered a delicacy) and scales (used in traditional medicine despite having no proven medical value). Over 1 million pangolins have been trafficked in the last decade.
