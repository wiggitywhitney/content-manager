- Jellyfish predated the first fish by millions of years

### Ecological Importance

- Important food source for sea turtles, some fish, and other marine animals
- Can indicate ocean health and climate changes
- Play a role in ocean nutrient cycling
- Some species are being studied for medical applications

## Conclusion
