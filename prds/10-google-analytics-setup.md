## Executive Summary

Set up Google Analytics tracking on the Micro.blog site to gain visibility into site traffic and visitor behavior, and document the complete process for future reference.

## Problem Statement

Currently, there is no analytics visibility into the Micro.blog site's traffic, visitor behavior, popular content, or user engagement patterns. Micro.blog does not provide built-in analytics, making it difficult to understand how the site is performing and what content resonates with readers.

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Goals
- Enable Google Analytics tracking on the Micro.blog site
- Gain visibility into site traffic, page views, and visitor behavior
- Document the setup process for future reference or troubleshooting

### Success Criteria
- Google Analytics tracking code successfully added to Micro.blog site
- Analytics data visible in Google Analytics dashboard within 24-48 hours
- Complete documentation created covering the entire setup process
- Documentation includes screenshots, troubleshooting tips, and verification steps

## Target Users

Primary user: Whitney Lee (site owner)

Secondary users: Future reference for anyone needing to:
- Set up Google Analytics on a new Micro.blog site
- Troubleshoot or verify existing analytics setup
- Understand how Micro.blog custom footer works

## User Journey

### Current State
1. User has no insight into site traffic
2. User cannot see which posts are popular
3. User cannot understand visitor demographics or behavior

### Future State
1. User can view real-time and historical traffic data in Google Analytics
2. User can identify top-performing content
3. User can understand visitor sources, behavior, and engagement
4. User has documented process for future reference

## Technical Approach

### Setup Process
1. **Google Analytics Account Setup**
   - Create or access Google Analytics account
   - Create new GA4 property for Micro.blog site
   - Obtain tracking code/measurement ID

2. **Micro.blog Integration**
   - Navigate to Posts → Design → Edit Footer
   - Add Google Analytics tracking code to custom footer
   - Save changes

3. **Verification**
   - Use Google Analytics real-time reporting to verify tracking
   - Check that page views are being recorded
   - Verify site appears in GA dashboard

4. **Documentation Creation**
   - Document step-by-step setup process
   - Include screenshots of key steps
   - Add troubleshooting section
   - Include verification checklist

### Integration Points
- Google Analytics platform (external service)
- Micro.blog custom footer feature
- Content-manager repository (for documentation storage)

## Implementation Milestones

- [x] Google Analytics account configured with Micro.blog property
- [x] Tracking code successfully added to Micro.blog footer
- [x] Analytics tracking verified and working
- [x] Complete setup documentation created
- [x] Documentation reviewed and finalized

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Tracking code placement issues**: Code may not fire correctly in footer
   - *Mitigation*: Use Google Analytics real-time view to verify immediately after adding code

2. **Data privacy concerns**: Analytics may track sensitive visitor information
   - *Mitigation*: Review GA4 privacy settings; consider adding privacy policy update

3. **Code conflicts**: Tracking code may conflict with Micro.blog theme
   - *Mitigation*: Test on a few pages; monitor for JavaScript errors in browser console

## Open Questions

- [ ] Do we need to update the site privacy policy to mention Google Analytics?
- [ ] Should we configure any specific GA4 events beyond default page views?
- [ ] Are there any specific reports or dashboards to set up in GA4?

## Success Metrics

- Analytics tracking active and recording data
- Documentation complete with all screenshots and steps
- Able to view traffic data in Google Analytics dashboard
- Process documented clearly enough to repeat without assistance

## Dependencies

- Active Micro.blog hosting account
- Google account for Analytics access
- Access to Micro.blog design settings

## Future Considerations

- Consider privacy-focused analytics alternatives (Plausible, Fathom)
- Explore setting up custom events for specific user actions
- Consider adding UTM parameter tracking for content shared on social media
- May want to integrate analytics data with content management workflows
