# PRD: Historical Content Spreadsheet Integration

**Issue**: [#6](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/content-manager/issues/6)
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: Medium
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-19

## Problem Statement

Whitney has 4 historical content tracking spreadsheets covering 2022-2024 that are separate from the current automated content publishing system (PRD #1). This historical content represents significant past work but is:

- **Isolated**: Not integrated with current Micro.blog automation
- **Inconsistently formatted**: Different column structures, title hyperlinks instead of URL columns
- **Selectively valuable**: Some content should be included (e.g., 4 key items from 2022), others may not (defunct VMware blog posts)
- **Manually managed**: No automated sync, requiring manual decisions about inclusion

## Solution Overview

Integrate historical spreadsheets into the automated content publishing system, handling format differences and enabling selective content inclusion. The solution must address:

1. **Format normalization**: Transform different spreadsheet structures into compatible format
2. **Selective inclusion**: Enable filtering/selection of which content to publish
3. **Integration approach**: Decide between consolidating into single source-of-truth vs. multi-spreadsheet architecture
4. **Content validation**: Handle edge cases like missing URLs, defunct links, conference pages

## Historical Spreadsheet Inventory

### Spreadsheet Sources
1. **2022 Content**: [Spreadsheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y5oxniWuw2R4UOOL00_oEQ1xRO1uaQPIQbvG_nt7vXc/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Estimated inclusion: ~4 key items
   - Format: Title hyperlinks (not separate URL column)

2. **2023 Content**: [Spreadsheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pwJz_r91m_zJWOI6XuqsMRQpwLnxAN32j-aIiJYuZm0/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Format: Title hyperlinks

3. **2024 Content (Spreadsheet 1)**: [Spreadsheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nz_v9_WfFanJcvC5WRcZ6S9JPLSGlYdwsyzRxNUGjjE/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Format: Title hyperlinks

4. **2024 Content (Spreadsheet 2)**: [Spreadsheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m7DTzOMu3Bkba8Mp3z4mDL0BVyJTCuYWrc20GlsmIrs/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Format: Title hyperlinks

### Known Format Differences
- **URL Storage**: Historical sheets use title hyperlinks instead of dedicated URL column
- **Link Quality**: Some titles link to conference webpages rather than actual content
- **Content Availability**: Some content may no longer be online (e.g., VMware blog â†’ Broadcom transition)
- **Column Structure**: TBD (requires detailed analysis)

## Open Questions & Decision Points

These questions require user decisions before implementation:

### 1. Architecture Decision
**Question**: Should we consolidate all content into the single source-of-truth spreadsheet, or support multiple spreadsheets as separate sources?

**Option A: Single Source of Truth (Consolidation)**
- **Pros**: Simple architecture, single sync script, unified view
- **Cons**: One-time migration work, loses historical organization, larger spreadsheet

**Option B: Multi-Spreadsheet Architecture**
- **Pros**: Preserves historical organization, can apply different rules per sheet
- **Cons**: More complex sync logic, multiple state tracking, harder to query across years

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- **Pros**: Selective migration (only chosen items moved to main sheet)
- **Cons**: Fragmented data, still requires multi-spreadsheet support for archives

**Option D: Single Spreadsheet with Multiple Tabs**
- **Pros**: Single source of truth, preserves historical organization by year, simpler than multi-file approach
- **Cons**: Sync script reads multiple tabs (moderate complexity increase), larger single file

**Decision**: [To be determined]

### 2. Selective Inclusion Strategy
**Question**: How should we decide which historical content to include?

**Approach Options**:
- **Manual Marking**: Add "Include" column to historical sheets, Whitney marks desired rows
- **Rule-Based Filtering**: Automated criteria (e.g., only Podcast/Presentation types, only items with valid URLs)
- **Review Workflow**: System suggests candidates, Whitney approves/rejects
- **Bulk Import + Manual Cleanup**: Import everything, remove unwanted posts via spreadsheet deletion

**Decision**: [To be determined]

### 3. Defunct Content Handling
**Question**: Should we include content that's no longer accessible online (e.g., VMware blog posts)?

**Considerations**:
- Historical record value vs. broken links
- Micro.blog post format (could note "archived" or "no longer available")
- Future content preservation strategy (Internet Archive, personal backups)

**Decision**: [To be determined]

### 4. URL Extraction from Hyperlinks
**Question**: How to handle title hyperlinks that point to conference pages instead of actual content?

**Approach Options**:
- **Skip**: Ignore rows where hyperlink isn't direct content URL
- **Extract**: Use conference page URL as placeholder
- **Manual Cleanup**: Require URL correction before import
- **Smart Detection**: Parse hyperlink, flag suspected non-content URLs for review

**Decision**: [To be determined]

### 5. Migration Timing
**Question**: Should historical content integration happen before or after PRD #1 Milestones 5-8 complete?

**Considerations**:
- PRD #1 establishes core CRUD functionality needed for this work
- Historical integration could inform multi-spreadsheet architecture decisions
- Delaying reduces scope creep, completing earlier provides comprehensive content view

**Decision**: [To be determined]

## Technical Requirements

### Format Normalization Needs
- [ ] Analyze all 4 spreadsheet structures (column names, data types, formats)
- [ ] Extract URLs from title hyperlinks programmatically
- [ ] Map historical Type values to standardized taxonomy (Podcast, Video, Blog, Presentation, Guest)
- [ ] Handle missing required fields (Date, Type, Link)
- [ ] Detect and flag low-quality links (conference pages, defunct URLs)

### Integration Options
- [ ] **Option A**: Append historical rows to main spreadsheet (one-time migration)
- [ ] **Option B**: Extend sync script to read multiple spreadsheets (ongoing multi-source)
- [ ] **Option C**: Manual curation into dedicated "Archive" tab in main spreadsheet
- [ ] **Option D**: Consolidate into tabs within single source-of-truth spreadsheet

### Selective Inclusion Mechanism
- [ ] Add "Include" column to historical sheets (if manual marking approach chosen)
- [ ] Implement filtering logic in sync script
- [ ] Support dry-run preview of what would be imported
- [ ] Enable incremental imports (partial backfill)

### Content Validation
- [ ] URL accessibility checking (HTTP status codes)
- [ ] Link quality scoring (direct content vs. conference/blog homepage)
- [ ] Duplicate detection (across historical + current spreadsheets)
- [ ] Date parsing for various historical formats

## User Experience

### Current State
1. Historical content exists only in separate spreadsheets
2. No visibility on Micro.blog site
3. Manual effort required to reference or share old work

### Desired State
1. Selected historical content visible on Micro.blog categories
2. Unified view of all Whitney's content (current + historical)
3. Clear indication of which historical items are included/excluded
4. Easy way to add more historical content over time

## Implementation Approach

*To be refined after open questions are resolved*

## Dependencies & Risks

### External Dependencies
- **PRD #1 Completion**: Requires CRUD operations (Milestones 5-8) for full functionality
- **Spreadsheet Access**: Service account needs read access to 4 historical spreadsheets
- **Historical Data Quality**: Depends on accuracy and completeness of old records

### Technical Risks
- **Format Complexity**: Historical sheets may have unexpected format variations
- **URL Extraction Accuracy**: Hyperlink parsing may miss or misinterpret URLs
- **Data Volume**: Large historical backfill could hit API rate limits or timeout
- **Duplicate Detection**: Same content might exist in multiple sheets

### Decision Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Supporting multiple formats could significantly expand complexity
- **Rework Risk**: Architectural decisions made now may need revision based on PRD #1 learnings
- **Selective Inclusion Burden**: Manual marking could become tedious for large datasets

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Phase Approach**: Start with single spreadsheet (2022) as pilot, iterate on learnings
- **Dry-Run First**: Always preview changes before committing to Micro.blog
- **Incremental Import**: Support partial imports to manage API limits and manual review burden
- **Architecture Flexibility**: Design sync script with pluggable format adapters for future formats

## Success Criteria

The feature is complete when:
1. âœ… All 4 historical spreadsheets analyzed and format differences documented
2. âœ… Open questions answered with clear decisions recorded in PRD
3. âœ… URL extraction working correctly from title hyperlinks
4. âœ… Selective inclusion mechanism implemented and tested
5. âœ… Historical content successfully synced to Micro.blog
6. âœ… Published posts appear in correct chronological order
7. âœ… Process documented for adding more historical content in future

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Create Separate PRD for Historical Integration
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Rationale**:
- Historical integration is distinct from core automation (PRD #1)
- Different format handling and selective inclusion concerns
- Allows PRD #1 to complete without scope creep
- Can leverage PRD #1's CRUD functionality once stable

**Impact**:
- Clearer separation of concerns
- PRD #1 remains focused on core automation
- Historical integration can start planning while PRD #1 in progress
- Enables parallel design discussion without blocking implementation

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-19 (PRD Creation)
- **Issue Created**: [#6](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/content-manager/issues/6)
- **PRD File Created**: `prds/6-historical-content-integration.md`
- **Status**: Planning phase - open questions identified
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Analyze historical spreadsheet formats in detail
  2. Make architecture decision (consolidation vs. multi-spreadsheet vs. multi-tab)
  3. Choose selective inclusion strategy
  4. Wait for PRD #1 Milestone 5 completion (CRUD operations needed)
