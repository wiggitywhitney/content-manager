# PRD: Automated Newsletter Solution with Subscriber Ownership

**Issue**: [#3](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/content-manager/issues/3)
**Status**: Future Planning
**Priority**: Low (Long-term implementation)
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Problem Statement

Based on comprehensive research documented in [`research/Micro.blog Newsletter Tool Comparison.md`](../research/Micro.blog%20Newsletter%20Tool%20Comparison.md), micro.blog's native newsletter functionality presents significant limitations:

- **Platform Dependency**: No direct mechanism for exporting subscriber lists, creating subtle vendor lock-in
- **Limited Automation**: Rigid triggers (only "long posts with titles" >300 characters) that don't align with diverse content strategies
- **Inflexible Scheduling**: Fixed daily sending times that may not match optimal posting schedules
- **Basic Customization**: Limited template options beyond simple CSS tweaks
- **Manual Overhead**: Static email introductions require manual updates for each issue

These limitations contradict the goal of true data ownership and flexible automation that aligns with the broader content-manager system philosophy.

## Research Foundation

The strategic analysis in the research document identifies a "Sovereignty Spectrum" with three viable approaches:

1. **Hosted Services with APIs**: Platforms like MailerLite, ConvertKit, or Mailchimp that offer robust APIs while maintaining subscriber export capabilities
2. **Self-Hosted Solutions**: Ghost, Sendy, or Keila for complete platform independence
3. **Custom Built Solution**: Maximum flexibility but highest technical investment

The research emphasizes that true "ownership" for technical users means programmatic access to subscriber data and automation capabilities, not just manual CSV exports.

## Solution Overview

Build an automated newsletter system that:

1. **Maintains Subscriber Sovereignty**: Full programmatic access to subscriber lists with multiple export options
2. **Integrates with Existing Systems**: Leverages content tracking spreadsheet and automated publishing workflows
3. **Provides Flexible Triggers**: Smart content selection beyond micro.blog's rigid character limits
4. **Enables Custom Automation**: API-driven workflow that can evolve with changing needs
5. **Supports Future Migration**: Architecture that allows switching between platforms without data loss

## Strategic Questions for Future Implementation

### Current State & Integration
- How should this automated newsletter solution integrate with the existing content-manager system (Google Sheets â†’ micro.blog sync)?
- Should this be an extension of that system, or a separate but related automation?
- How can the newsletter system leverage data already being tracked in the spreadsheet?

### Content Strategy & Triggers
- What should trigger newsletter creation?
  - New blog posts from micro.blog RSS feed?
  - Weekly/monthly digest of content from spreadsheet?
  - Highlighted content using the "Highlight" column from dynamic about page PRD?
  - Combination of multiple content sources?
- Should different content types (podcast, video, blog, presentations) have different newsletter formats?
- How can the system handle content that spans multiple weeks or irregular posting schedules?

### Technical Architecture Decisions
Based on research analysis, which approach aligns with long-term goals:

**Path A: Custom Newsletter System**
- Build newsletter generation and sending entirely within existing GitHub Actions workflow
- Maximum sovereignty but requires building subscriber management, email sending, etc.
- Integration with services like Amazon SES for actual email delivery

**Path B: Hosted Service Integration**
- Use APIs from MailerLite (user-friendly, generous free tier) or ConvertKit (creator-focused)
- Maintain subscriber ownership through API access and CSV exports
- Balance between convenience and control

**Path C: Self-Hosted Platform**
- Ghost (full blog + newsletter platform) or Sendy (specialized email sending)
- Complete platform independence but significant ongoing technical commitment
- May require separate hosting infrastructure

### Subscriber Management & Growth
- How should subscriber acquisition work?
  - Signup forms embedded in micro.blog site?
  - Integration with existing social media and content distribution?
  - Manual import capabilities for existing contacts?
- Should subscriber data be synchronized with the content tracking spreadsheet?
- How can the system handle subscriber preferences, segmentation, and unsubscribes?
- What analytics and growth metrics are needed?

### Content Format & Personalization
- What should the newsletter content structure include?
  - Recent content summary with links?
  - Featured/highlighted content from spreadsheet?
  - Personal commentary or context from Whitney?
  - Upcoming events or speaking engagements?
- How can content be personalized or segmented by subscriber interests?
- Should there be multiple newsletter formats (weekly digest, new content alerts, special announcements)?

### Timeline & Implementation Priorities
- Is this a "start simple and evolve" project or comprehensive from the start?
- How does this priority compare to other PRDs (automated publishing, dynamic about page)?
- What's the minimum viable product for initial validation?
- Should implementation begin with research and prototyping phase?

### Platform Migration & Future-Proofing
- How can the system be designed to support easy migration between platforms?
- What data formats and APIs should be prioritized for maximum portability?
- How can vendor lock-in be avoided while still leveraging platform-specific features?
- What backup and disaster recovery plans are needed for subscriber data?

## Success Criteria (Future Definition)

### Functional Requirements (To Be Defined)
- [ ] Subscriber list fully owned and exportable
- [ ] Automated content collection from multiple sources
- [ ] Flexible sending triggers and scheduling
- [ ] Professional email templates and formatting
- [ ] Integration with existing content-manager workflows
- [ ] Subscriber management (signup, unsubscribe, preferences)

### Non-Functional Requirements (To Be Defined)
- [ ] Platform independence with migration capabilities
- [ ] Reliable delivery and professional appearance
- [ ] Comprehensive analytics and growth tracking
- [ ] Compliance with email regulations (CAN-SPAM, GDPR)
- [ ] Cost-effective scaling as subscriber base grows

## Implementation Approach (Future Planning)

### Research & Decision Phase
When ready to implement, begin with:

1. **Platform Evaluation**: Test APIs and features of top candidates identified in research
2. **Integration Prototyping**: Build small proof-of-concept connecting to existing systems
3. **Subscriber Acquisition Strategy**: Design signup flows and integration points
4. **Content Strategy Refinement**: Define newsletter formats and trigger logic
5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluate hosted vs. self-hosted based on current scale

### Potential Technology Stack
- **Hosted Option**: MailerLite or ConvertKit API integration within GitHub Actions
- **Self-Hosted Option**: Ghost or Sendy with dedicated server infrastructure
- **Custom Option**: Python/Node.js with Amazon SES and custom subscriber management
- **Integration Layer**: Extensions to existing GitHub Actions workflow

## Dependencies & Considerations

### External Dependencies
- **Email Deliverability**: Reputation management and compliance requirements
- **Platform APIs**: Reliability and feature set of chosen newsletter service
- **Integration Points**: Compatibility with existing micro.blog and spreadsheet systems
- **Subscriber Behavior**: Engagement patterns and growth expectations

### Technical Risks
- **Email Deliverability**: Custom solutions may face spam filtering challenges
- **Compliance Requirements**: GDPR, CAN-SPAM, and other regulations
- **Platform Changes**: API deprecations or policy changes in chosen service
- **Scale Challenges**: Performance and cost implications of subscriber growth

### Strategic Risks
- **Feature Creep**: Newsletter system becoming overly complex
- **Maintenance Burden**: Long-term commitment to system updates and monitoring
- **Migration Complexity**: Difficulty switching platforms after subscriber base grows
- **Opportunity Cost**: Time investment vs. other content-manager priorities

## Definition of Done (Future Refinement)

This feature will be complete when:
1. Whitney has full programmatic access to her subscriber list
2. Newsletter creation and sending is automated based on defined triggers
3. Subscriber acquisition and management workflows are streamlined
4. The system integrates seamlessly with existing content-manager automation
5. Migration capabilities preserve subscriber ownership across platform changes
6. The solution scales cost-effectively with subscriber growth
