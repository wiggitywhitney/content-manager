# Mantis Shrimp Facts

Mantis shrimps are marine crustaceans with superpowers that seem straight out of science fiction. They pack the fastest punch in the animal kingdom and see colors humans can't even imagine!

## The Fastest Punch on Earth

- **Strike Speed**: Their club-like appendages accelerate at 10,000 times the force of gravity
- **Speed**: Can strike at 50 mph (80 km/h) in water
- **Force**: Generates the same force as a .22 caliber bullet
- **Cavitation Bubbles**: The punch is so fast it creates cavitation bubbles that collapse with a shockwave and flash of light
- **Double Hit**: Prey gets hit twice - once by the club, again by the shockwave

## Extraordinary Vision

- **16 Color Receptors**: Humans have 3, mantis shrimps have 16 types of color receptors
- **Polarized Light**: Can see polarized light in ways humans can't comprehend
- **Ultraviolet & Infrared**: See wavelengths far beyond human capability
- **Independent Eyes**: Each eye can move independently and has trinocular vision
- **Depth Perception**: Each eye alone can judge depth (humans need two eyes for this)

## Types of Mantis Shrimp

- **Smashers**: Have club-like appendages for breaking shells
- **Spearers**: Have sharp, spiny appendages for impaling soft-bodied prey
- **400+ Species**: Found worldwide in tropical and subtropical waters

## Behavior

- **Territorial**: Fiercely defend their burrows
- **Monogamous**: Some species mate for life
- **Aquarium Breakers**: Can break aquarium glass with their strikes (nicknamed "thumb splitters" by fishermen)
- **Complex Communication**: Use visual signals and fluorescent displays

## Size

Most species are 4-12 inches long, though the largest can reach 15 inches. Despite their small size, they're among the most powerful predators in the ocean!
