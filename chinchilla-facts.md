# Chinchilla Facts

Chinchillas are adorable rodents native to the Andes Mountains of South America, known for their incredibly soft fur and playful personalities.

## Physical Characteristics

- **Fur Density**: Chinchillas have the densest fur of any land mammal, with up to 60 hairs growing from a single follicle (humans have only 1-2 hairs per follicle)
- **Size**: They typically weigh 1-2 pounds and measure 9-15 inches in body length
- **Tail**: Their bushy tails add another 3-6 inches to their length
- **Lifespan**: In captivity, chinchillas can live 10-20 years, making them long-term companions

## Unique Adaptations

- **Dust Baths**: Chinchillas clean themselves by rolling in volcanic ash or special dust, which absorbs oils and moisture from their dense fur
- **Temperature Sensitivity**: Their thick fur makes them susceptible to overheating; they thrive in temperatures between 60-70Â°F
- **Vertical Jumpers**: Chinchillas can leap up to 6 feet high, making them excellent climbers in their mountainous habitat
- **Large Ears**: Their oversized ears help regulate body temperature and provide excellent hearing

## Behavior

- **Nocturnal**: Chinchillas are most active during dawn and dusk (crepuscular)
- **Social Creatures**: In the wild, they live in colonies called "herds" that can contain over 100 individuals
- **Vocal Communication**: They make a variety of sounds including barks, chirps, and warning calls
- **Chewing**: Like all rodents, their teeth continuously grow, so they must constantly chew to keep them worn down

## Conservation

Wild chinchillas are critically endangered due to habitat loss and historical overhunting for their fur. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect remaining populations in Chile.
