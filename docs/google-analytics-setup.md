## Accessing Analytics

**Dashboard:** https://analytics.google.com

**Navigation:**
1. Select "Whitney Lee Personal" account (if you have multiple accounts)
2. Select "whitneylee.com" property
3. View reports in the left sidebar:
   - Reports → Realtime (see live visitors)
   - Reports → Life cycle → Acquisition (traffic sources)
   - Reports → Life cycle → Engagement (page views, events)

## Security Considerations

### Measurement ID Visibility
- The Measurement ID (G-XW8L9T3MN2) is **public** and visible in the HTML source of whitneylee.com
- This is by design - it allows sending data TO Google Analytics
- It does NOT grant access to view analytics data or your Google account

### Domain Restrictions (Optional - Future Enhancement)
While the tracking code is public, you can configure additional protections:

**Option 1: Configure Your Domains**
- Go to: Admin → Data Streams → whitneylee.com → Configure tag settings
- Configure cross-domain settings to mark whitneylee.com as your legitimate domain

**Option 2: Data Filters**
- Go to: Admin → Data Settings → Data Filters
- Create filters to exclude traffic from unauthorized domains
- This won't prevent data collection but keeps reports clean

**Note:** These security configurations are optional and can be set up anytime.

## Troubleshooting

### Tag Not Detected
If verification fails:
1. Ensure tracking code is in the Custom Footer (not Custom CSS)
2. Check for JavaScript errors in browser console (F12)
3. Verify code is pasted exactly as provided (no extra characters)
4. Clear Micro.blog cache and reload

### No Data in Reports
- Data collection can take 24-48 hours to begin
- Check Admin → Data Streams → whitneylee.com for "No data received" status
- Use Realtime reports to see immediate traffic
- Visit your own website to generate test traffic

### Code Conflicts
If the site breaks after adding code:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Ensure `</script>` tags are properly closed
3. Verify no duplicate tracking codes on the page

## Future Considerations

### Privacy & Compliance
- Consider adding/updating privacy policy to mention Google Analytics
- Review GDPR/CCPA requirements if applicable
- Consider cookie consent banner if targeting EU users

### Advanced Tracking
- Set up custom events for specific user actions
- Configure UTM parameters for social media tracking
- Explore custom dimensions and metrics

### Alternative Analytics
- Consider privacy-focused alternatives (Plausible, Fathom)
- Evaluate if GA4 meets all analytics needs
- Review data retention policies
