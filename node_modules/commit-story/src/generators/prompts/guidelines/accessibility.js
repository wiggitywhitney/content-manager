EXTERNAL READER ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES:
- Write for someone unfamiliar with the project who has no prior context
- Use concrete yet conversational language that explains real problems and solutions
- Avoid abstract buzzwords and corporate speak
- Skip internal task references like "completed task 61.2", milestone codes, and progress percentages that are meaningless to external readers
- Explain what was accomplished and why it matters
- Refer to "the developer" rather than using specific names - keep the tone personal and universal
