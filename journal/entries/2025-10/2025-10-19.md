### Summary - ea836f82

A new PRD was created for integrating historical content spreadsheets into the automated content publishing system. This document outlines the challenges posed by four separate historical spreadsheets, each with different formats and content structures, and seeks to establish a unified method for incorporating this content into Micro.blog.

In the discussions, the developer and AI assistant focused on the primary goal of making historical content visible on the Micro.blog site, while also addressing the need for selective inclusion of content. They explored various integration approaches, including a single source-of-truth spreadsheet versus multiple spreadsheets, and even considered a hybrid solution with multiple tabs in a single spreadsheet. The conversation highlighted the importance of normalizing formats, enabling selective inclusion, and planning the timing of integration relative to existing milestones.

The developer raised critical questions about how to handle title hyperlinks, whether to include defunct content, and how to manage the migration process effectively. They also emphasized the need for a clear strategy around the architecture of the integration, capturing these open questions in the PRD for later decisions.

Overall, this session demonstrated a thoughtful blend of technical documentation and strategic planning, setting the stage for future work while addressing potential challenges and ensuring the project remains focused on its objectives.

### Development Dialogue - ea836f82

> **Human:** "Love this but another option perhaps (#4) is a single source of truth spreadsheet with multiple tabs. Keep this as-is but add that option for future consideration"
> **Assistant:** "Perfect! Let me add that as Option D to the Architecture Decision section:"

> **Human:** "nope. commit and push please"

### Technical Decisions - ea836f82

- **DECISION: Micro.blog API Capabilities Research** (Discussed)
  - Researching Micro.blog API capabilities to inform implementation.
  - Clarified that categories (not pages) are the appropriate mechanism for content organization.
  - Discussed potential limitations of the API regarding page management and visibility.

- **DECISION: Update PRD with API Analysis** (Discussed)
  - Decided to integrate API capabilities analysis directly into the PRD for better context.
  - Emphasized the importance of linking to the capabilities document throughout the PRD.
  - Acknowledged the need for clear separation of concerns between capabilities and project-specific analysis.

- **DECISION: Spreadsheet-Based State Tracking** (Discussed)
  - Using spreadsheet Column H ("Micro.blog URL") as sync state instead of a separate state file.
  - Simplifies state management (no separate file to maintain).
  - Enables visible sync status directly in the spreadsheet.

- **DECISION: Auto-Delete Orphaned Posts** (Discussed)
  - Spreadsheet is single source of truth - should drive Micro.blog state completely.
  - Deleting spreadsheet row should delete corresponding post.
  - Removes stale posts automatically.

- **DECISION: Chronological Ordering via Published Date Parameter** (Discussed)
  - Need posts to appear in chronological order by actual publication date.
  - Micro.blog supports `published` parameter per Micropub spec.
  - Allows backfilling old content without timeline disruption.
