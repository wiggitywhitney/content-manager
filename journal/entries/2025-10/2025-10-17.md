## 11:32:14 AM GMT+1 - Commit: 7b40283e - feat(prd-1): complete Milestone 1 - parsing, validation, and pretty logging

### Summary - 7b40283e

The developer completed Milestone 1 by implementing parsing, validation, and pretty logging in a comprehensive script designed to handle content synchronization. This work involved creating a new file, `src/sync-content.js`, which encapsulates all the logic for parsing spreadsheet rows into structured objects, validating those objects, and outputting results in a visually appealing format.

The first part, Step 1.4, focused on parsing the raw spreadsheet data into objects with named fields. The developer successfully implemented a `parseRow()` function that converts each row into a structured object while correctly detecting header rows. Following that, Step 1.5 introduced validation logic through a `validateContent()` function, ensuring that all required fields were present while gracefully handling optional fields and skipping month header rows. This validation also included tracking statistics on valid and invalid rows, which provided clearer insights into the data quality.

In Step 1.6, the developer added pretty logging features, enhancing the output with timestamps, visual indicators for valid and skipped rows, and comprehensive statistics on the processed data. This included a summary that showed how many rows were valid and what types they belonged to, making it easier to assess results at a glance.

Throughout the chat, the developer expressed a clear plan to create a single evolving codebase that would handle all three steps without creating throwaway scripts. The discussions highlighted a methodical approach to work, with the developer frequently testing the script's functionality after each major addition to ensure everything worked as intended. This iterative testing was crucial in confirming that parsing, validation, and logging were functioning correctly before marking each step complete.

Additionally, the developer documented the milestones and progress in the project requirements document, updating it to reflect the completion of these steps and the successful testing of the script, which processed 88 rows in total, identifying 61 valid content items across different types.
