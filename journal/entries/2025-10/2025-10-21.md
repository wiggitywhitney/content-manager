### Summary - e2ab80d1

Cross-posting disable warnings were added to the documentation for testing and bulk operations in PRD-1. The developer engaged in a session to enhance the project by incorporating important reminders to disable cross-posting in Micro.blog settings before running tests or back-filling historical content. This precaution aims to prevent unintentional spamming of connected social accounts during various operations.

Initially, the developer outlined their recent accomplishments, including the completion of Milestone 5, which involved implementing full CRUD operations for Google Sheets synchronization with Micro.blog, resulting in the creation of 61 posts. They also documented their progress and outlined strategies for future tasks, identifying the next priority as enhancing URL slugs for better SEO. 

During the chat session, the developer instructed the AI to add checks for disabling cross-posting in multiple sections of the PRD. The AI responded promptly, integrating warnings in key areas, including the milestone header and specific steps for research, implementation, and retrospective notes. This ensures that the developer will be reminded to disable cross-posting in various scenarios, safeguarding against unwanted content distribution.

After confirming the changes, the developer requested the AI to commit the updates, which were then successfully pushed. The session concluded with a clear plan for ongoing development focused on improving content handling and user experience.
