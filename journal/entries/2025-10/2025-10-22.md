### Summary - 63f4c545

Documentation for Milestone 9 regarding content-based URL slugs was added. This update included a new section in the microblog API capabilities documentation that outlines how URLs are generated and how the `mp-slug` parameter can be utilized to create custom slugs. The developer and AI assistant discussed potential scenarios regarding duplicate post titles, particularly when the same talk is delivered at different conferences. They explored the implications of using the `name` parameter for generating slugs and confirmed that Micro.blog supports the `mp-slug` parameter, allowing for custom slug suggestions.

A thorough examination of the Micro.blog documentation clarified that while the `name` parameter influences slug creation, the system can also modify suggested slugs if there are conflicts. The developer decided that using the same `mp-slug` for regenerated posts would be best to maintain URL consistency, especially when updates occur. This decision was documented as a key aspect of the implementation strategy, ensuring that future iterations of the project remain coherent.

Throughout the session, the developer addressed several edge cases and implementation details, such as ensuring that slugs are unique and descriptive, particularly for posts with identical titles. The AI assistant assisted by suggesting testing strategies to validate both the automatic slug generation and user-defined slugs, aiming for a user-friendly and SEO-optimized URL structure.

Overall, the session focused on refining the documentation and planning for the implementation of content-based URL slugs, setting a clear direction for enhancing the user experience and addressing potential challenges with duplicate content.

### Development Dialogue - 63f4c545

> **Human:** "First let's discuss what should happen when there are two very similar posts. Like when I deliver the same talk (same title) but at two different conferences and each gets its own post"

> **Assistant:** "Excellent question! This is exactly the kind of edge case we should think through before implementing. Let's explore the scenarios..."

> **Human:** "Document this in @docs/microblog-api-capabilities.md so a future AI instance can understand it with no additional context. Our naming also has to support when a spreadsheet line is updated and the post is regenerated. Can we use the same name for the regenerated post? I think that is best." 

> **Assistant:** "Now let me add a comprehensive section about URL slug generation after the Available Parameters section..."

### Technical Decisions - 63f4c545

- **DECISION: Use mp-slug for Content-Based URLs and Slug Persistence** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/1-automated-content-publishing.md
  - Current posts use timestamp URLs due to missing `name` parameter
  - Content-based URLs improve SEO and user experience
  - Duplicate talk titles need unique URLs
  - Post updates must preserve URLs even when titles change
  - Micro.blog supports `mp-slug` Micropub extension for custom URL slugs
  - Server may accept or modify suggested slug to avoid URL conflicts
  - Recommended to use the same `mp-slug` when regenerating posts
