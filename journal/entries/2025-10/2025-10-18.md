### Summary - f236ffae

A GitHub Actions workflow was added to automate content synchronization for Milestone 2. This new file, located at `.github/workflows/sync-content.yml`, outlines a process that will run the existing `sync-content.js` script in a CI environment. The workflow is designed to operate in two modes: it can be triggered manually for testing and will later be scheduled to run hourly.

The decision to implement this workflow stemmed from the completion of Milestone 1, which involved local setup, Google Sheets API authentication, and successful parsing and validation of spreadsheet data. The developer recognized that automating the synchronization process was crucial for transitioning from a manual development tool to a fully automated system. During the discussions, the developer and the AI assistant explored how to adapt credential handling to work seamlessly in both local and CI environments, ensuring that the existing script could utilize environment variables for service account credentials, which had already been prepared for this dual usage.

The assistant guided the developer through the necessary steps, including creating the workflow file and configuring the GitHub Secret to store the service account JSON securely. As they discussed the implementation, they decided to keep the logging format consistent with what had been used locally, postponing any enhancements for JSON logging until after the initial testing phase. This approach allowed them to focus on getting the automation functioning correctly before adding more complexity.

Overall, this session marked a significant step toward achieving a fully automated publishing workflow, with the groundwork laid for future enhancements. The developer's proactive planning and thorough discussions ensured a smooth integration of the GitHub Actions workflow, setting the stage for ongoing progress in the project.

### Development Dialogue - f236ffae

> **Human:** "yes"
> **Assistant:** "Perfect! Let me help you design the GitHub Actions integration. First, I'll create a todo list to track our progress through Milestone 2."

> **Human:** "A - you do it"
> **Assistant:** "Perfect! GitHub Secret configured successfully. Let me update the todo list and move to testing:"

### Technical Decisions - f236ffae

- **DECISION: GitHub Actions Integration for Milestone 2** (Implemented) - FILES: [.github/workflows/sync-content.yml]
  - Move working code into GitHub Actions for automation
  - Enables scheduled execution of sync script
  - Validates secret management strategy in CI environment
  - Workflow includes manual trigger for testing and hourly schedule
  Tradeoffs: Keep pretty logs for now; JSON logging can be added later as an enhancement.

## 7:53:09 AM GMT+1 - Commit: f47c747c - fix(prd-1): skip devDependencies in CI workflow

### Summary - f47c747c

The developer modified the CI workflow configuration by changing the command to install dependencies from `npm ci` to `npm ci --omit=dev`. This change was made to skip installing development dependencies, which was necessary because the workflow was previously failing due to a missing local file for a devDependency called `commit-story`. After identifying the issue through the logs, the developer implemented this fix to ensure that only production dependencies are installed for the sync script.
