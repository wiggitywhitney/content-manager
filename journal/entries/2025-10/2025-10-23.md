### Summary - bff408da

Automatic URL regeneration for non-title slugs was added to the project, addressing a critical issue with how posts were being generated. The previous implementation resulted in posts receiving timestamp URLs (like `/130000.html`) instead of more readable, content-based slugs. This problem arose because the system did not send the `name` parameter, which is essential for creating titled posts.

During the session, the developer explored various approaches for resolving this issue. Initially, they attempted to implement a method that would generate content-based slugs utilizing the `name` parameter. However, testing revealed that while this approach successfully created SEO-friendly URLs, it resulted in a poor user experience; posts displayed titles that required an extra click to access the content instead of presenting it directly. This format was deemed unacceptable for the project's primary use case, which focuses on content aggregation.

Through discussions and testing, the developer discovered that Micro.blog's behavior could be inconsistent, sometimes failing to extract titles from content due to various formatting issues, including the presence of emojis or the absence of links. As a result, the developer decided to implement a regeneration system that would check for non-title URLs (both timestamp and short hashes) during the hourly sync process. This solution would automatically delete and recreate posts with non-title URLs, ensuring that all posts eventually receive a clean, content-based slug.

The conversation also highlighted the need for a safeguard against infinite loops, where the regeneration process could repeatedly fail and generate the same non-title URLs. Ultimately, the decision was made to allow the system to attempt regeneration without excessive safeguards, trusting that the automatic nature of the process would handle most edge cases effectively.

By the end of the session, the developer successfully implemented the URL regeneration feature, which began fixing most of the non-title URLs while accepting that a couple of edge cases would continue to regenerate indefinitely. This pragmatic approach prioritized efficiency and effectiveness over a perfect outcome, aligning well with the project's goals. The findings and decisions were documented in the PRD, marking the completion of this milestone.

### Development Dialogue - bff408da

> **Human:** "I don't like the change [Image #1] - the new ones with the bolded title are no bueno. You have to click into a link and then click through to the content, it is a bad user experience."

> **Assistant:** "Ah, I see the problem! The updates added the `name` parameter to existing posts, which changed them from 'untitled posts' (just content) to 'titled posts' (title + content). This creates the extra click-through you're seeing."

> **Human:** "Cross-posting disabled. What's next?"

> **Assistant:** "Perfect! Let's start with testing. I'll create a test script to experiment with `name` and `mp-slug` parameters."

> **Human:** "Okay. Time to let it go. We've done our best."

### Technical Decisions - bff408da

- **DECISION: Reject Content-Based URL Slugs** (Discussed) 
  - Milestone 9 cancelled after research and testing
  - Direct content display more important than SEO-friendly URLs for this use case
  Tradeoffs: Accept timestamp URLs to maintain good UX

- **DECISION: Automatic URL Regeneration for Non-Title Slugs** (Implemented) - FILES: src/sync-content.js
  - Implemented automatic URL regeneration during hourly sync
  - Detects non-title URLs in Column H and regenerates them
  Tradeoffs: Most posts get SEO-friendly URLs automatically; 2-3 posts may regenerate repeatedly (acceptable for automation)

## 6:14:04 PM GMT+1 - Commit: 856ea137 - docs(prd-1): fix titled posts UX issue and update documentation

### Summary - 856ea137

The developer updated the README documentation to fix a user experience issue by correcting category URLs from `/categories/` to direct paths like `/podcast/`, ensuring easier access for the users. This change was part of a broader effort to address a problem where 55 posts displayed with a poor user experience due to having bolded titles and requiring multiple clicks to access content. The root cause was linked to a leftover `name` parameter from earlier testing that resulted in the creation of titled posts instead of untitled ones.

During the discussions, the developer expressed dissatisfaction with the way the website was presenting certain posts, noting that the bolded format was cumbersome for users. They collaboratively identified the need to delete the problematic titled posts and recreate them without the `name` parameter to streamline navigation. A script was developed to automate this process, resulting in the successful deletion and recreation of the posts with improved formatting.

After executing the fix, the developer confirmed with the user that the website's functionality was restored to meet the desired standards, leading to positive feedback about the changes. Additionally, the developer documented the process and the findings to ensure clarity and provide a foundation for future enhancements. They also initiated a new milestone concerning Google Analytics integration, planning to document the manual setup process for future reference. Overall, this session encompassed both technical fixes and strategic planning, addressing immediate user experience issues while laying groundwork for ongoing improvements.
