### Summary - 74e5a5d5

A PRD for an automated content publishing system was added to the project repository. This document details a solution to streamline Whitney's content publishing process from Google Sheets to her micro.blog site, addressing the current manual and error-prone workflow. During the discussions, the developer and assistant outlined key features, including the need for synchronization between the spreadsheet and the blog, automatic posting of new content, and handling of edits and deletions.

The conversation explored the content structure in the spreadsheet, with Whitney confirming the inclusion of various content types such as podcasts, videos, and blog posts. They decided on a system that triggers posts upon new row additions, creating a seamless experience for content management. The developer specified that the posts should feature a clickable title and date, while also ensuring that inactive pages are automatically hidden after four months of no activity.

Additionally, they discussed implementation details, opting for GitHub Actions to manage the automation, and concluded that error handling should include email notifications and GitHub issues for persistent failures. The assistant confirmed the technical feasibility of editing posts while maintaining the original date. After synthesizing all the requirements, the PRD was created, marking a significant step towards automating the content publishing process.

### Development Dialogue - 74e5a5d5

> **Human:** "5 pages seems right: Podcast (just mine), Videos, Blog Posts, Conference Talks, and Guest Appearances"

> **Human:** "Is it possible for the website to stay in sync with the spreadsheet? If a row gets removed from the spreadsheet, it gets removed from the website? If an error happens, no biggie, the event should get picked up next hour check (or whatever), plus an email and github issue"

> **Human:** "This is great. Two more things: If a page hasn't been updated in 4 months, hide it. Also Content mapping: 5 pages (Podcast, Video, Blog, Present, Guest)"

## 6:52:08 AM CDT - Commit: 621acd73 - Add PRD for dynamic about page with content highlights

### Summary - 621acd73

A PRD was added for a dynamic about page that highlights specific content. The developer engaged in discussions about the new feature's requirements, focusing on how to automate the showcasing of recent achievements from a Google Sheets tracker on Whitney's micro.blog site. The conversation explored the need for a new column in the spreadsheet to designate highlight-worthy content, along with considerations for content selection logic, including how to prioritize multiple highlights and manage fallback scenarios when no recent highlights are available.

Among the proposed solutions, there was a focus on creating a seamless user experience that automatically updates the about page with the most recent highlighted content while also allowing for manual overrides during special campaigns. The developer noted potential issues with the spreadsheet schema evolution and the importance of maintaining compatibility with existing systems. The session concluded with a commitment to push the PRD, setting the stage for the implementation of this dynamic feature.

## 7:38:41 AM CDT - Commit: 2f099210 - Add PRD for automated newsletter solution with research foundation

### Summary - 2f099210

A new Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an automated newsletter solution was created, laying the groundwork for future development. This document highlights significant limitations of micro.blog's existing newsletter functionality, such as vendor lock-in due to platform dependency, lack of flexible automation, and insufficient customization options. Based on comprehensive research detailed in a separate analysis, the PRD emphasizes the importance of subscriber ownership and programmatic access to data while presenting various approaches for a more robust solution.

The discussions leading to this PRD revolved around understanding how the automated newsletter would integrate with the existing content-manager system, particularly the synchronization with Google Sheets. The developer considered whether this solution should be an extension of that system or a standalone feature. The need for flexible triggers for the newsletter was also explored, including ideas like using new blog posts or weekly content digests.

Three potential paths for implementation were identified: building a custom newsletter system within the current automation framework, integrating with hosted service APIs like MailerLite or ConvertKit to maintain subscriber ownership, or opting for a self-hosted solution such as Ghost or Sendy. The developer expressed a preference for documenting these strategic questions in the PRD to facilitate future planning, highlighting the need for a clear framework as they consider their options down the line.

Overall, this session resulted in a solid foundation for future newsletter automation, with strategic considerations and a detailed understanding of the challenges and opportunities involved. The commitment to revisit this project when ready signifies a thoughtful approach to development, aligning with the developer's long-term goals.
