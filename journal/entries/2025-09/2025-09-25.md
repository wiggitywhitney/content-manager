### Summary - 05426466

The initial commit integrated commit-story functionality into the project, establishing a framework for generating narrative journal entries from git commits. During the session, the developer sought clarification on initializing the project and setting up necessary configurations. They confirmed the need to run the `/init` command, which would create the initial project structure, and discussed the creation of a CLAUDE.md file to guide future instances of Claude Code.

The developer requested specific slash commands related to Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) from an external source. They aimed to implement these commands directly in their project, which led to the retrieval and structuring of command files such as `/prd-create`, `/prd-done`, and several others that outline workflows for managing PRDs.

As the developer proceeded to set up the commit-story tool, they navigated issues related to existing git hooks and proper API key configuration. They learned that the hooks needed to be installed on a per-repository basis and that the current setup required initializing a new git repository in the project directory. After successfully setting up the commit-story tool, they verified the functionality of the post-commit hook, which generates journal entries for each commit.

The session concluded with preparations to create a new GitHub repository, but the developer faced challenges related to storing sensitive information, specifically an API key, in git history. The discussion underscored the importance of managing sensitive data effectively while implementing new features and tools within the project.

### Development Dialogue - 05426466

> **Human:** "Do I need to run /init? Right now I have no code, just slash commands"
> **Assistant:** "Yes, you should run `/init` to set up your project. The `/init` command will help you create the initial project structure, configuration files, and dependencies you need to get started."

> **Human:** "Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository. [...] Do not make up information such as 'Common Development Tasks', 'Tips for Development', 'Support and Documentation' unless this is expressly included in other files that you read."
> **Assistant:** "[...] I'll create a basic CLAUDE.md file that can be expanded as the project develops."

> **Human:** "I want the slash commands from this page that are prefixed with /prd https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/tree/main/shared-prompts"
> **Assistant:** "[...] I would need to see the actual content of each command file to understand their specific functionality and prompts."

> **Human:** "I need you to fetch the complete raw markdown content from these GitHub URLs and return each file's content exactly as it appears [...] For each file, return the complete content including YAML frontmatter."
> **Assistant:** "[...] I'll fetch the complete raw markdown content from each of those GitHub URLs for you."

> **Human:** "I want to make a slash command /prd-create with these contents: ---
name: prd-create
description: Create documentation-first PRDs that guide development through user-facing content
category: project-management
---"
> **Assistant:** "The `/prd-create` slash command has been created successfully."

### Technical Decisions - 05426466

- **DECISION: Create CLAUDE.md file** (Discussed)
  - Created a basic CLAUDE.md file since this is a fresh repository with no existing code, configuration files, or project structure.
  - The file acknowledges the current empty state and can be expanded as you add frameworks, build tools, and establish the project architecture.

- **DECISION: Implement /prd commands** (Discussed)
  - The developer wanted the exact /prd commands from a specified GitHub page to be available in the project.
  - The assistant confirmed the need to fetch the raw content of each command file to understand their specific functionality and prompts.

- **DECISION: Use commit-story for commit messages** (Discussed)
  - The developer inquired about using commit-story for generating commit messages in the repository.
  - The assistant explained how commit-story works and its integration with git hooks.

- **DECISION: Initialize git repository** (Discussed)
  - The developer decided to initialize the current directory as its own git repository to use commit-story effectively.
  - The assistant confirmed the need to set up the repository for commit-story to function properly.

- **DECISION: Manage API key securely** (Discussed)
  - The developer expressed the need to ensure the OpenAI API key is not exposed in the repository.
  - The assistant confirmed that the .env file should be added to .gitignore to prevent it from being tracked by git.

- **DECISION: Remove sensitive information from git history** (Discussed)
  - The assistant noted that the API key was detected in the initial commit and suggested rewriting the git history to remove it completely.
  - The developer agreed to omit the sensitive information from the repository.
