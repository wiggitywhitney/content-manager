### Summary - 588f462c

A journal entry documenting the progress and status of various projects was added, reflecting on the completion of the PRD-20 feature, which introduced a two-tier sorting system for content publishing that prioritizes posts with links. The entry confirmed that the core functionality was implemented correctly and validated through testing. Throughout the session, the developer engaged in discussions about the next steps across multiple projects, including content-manager, commit-story, and KubeHound, while seeking updates on the journal repository.

The developer expressed a desire to assess their progress and outlined specific next steps for each project. For content-manager, they confirmed the completion of PRD-20 and discussed the need to commit the changes made in the journal entry. In the context of commit-story, they identified that the next step was to release version 1.3.0, contingent upon user-driven external testing. The KubeHound demo was also highlighted, where the developer aimed to ensure the project met the necessary standards for an upcoming presentation.

The AI assistant helped the developer navigate through the repository structures and provided a comprehensive status update across all projects, including identifying the need for specific actions like committing journal entries and updating project documentation. The assistant also addressed a specific issue regarding the visibility of a recent post, confirming that it was properly categorized but not appearing on the expected page, suggesting it might be a caching issue with the Micro.blog platform.

Overall, the session was productive, focusing on documenting achievements, strategizing next steps, and resolving specific issues within the content management processes. The developer's approach demonstrated a clear commitment to maintaining project flow and addressing any challenges that arose in their workflows.

### Development Dialogue - 588f462c

> **Human:** "I'm interested in what my next step is across projects. Are you able to check on that? What's the next step for commit story? I think it's to release a new update. That's exciting. [...] Also, the journal repo, that's an Obsidian vault. I want a status update on that."
> **Assistant:** "I'll check all your projects for a comprehensive status update. Let me look at each one."

> **Human:** "For content-manager, they confirmed the completion of PRD-20 and discussed the need to commit the changes made in the journal entry."
> **Assistant:** "Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me compile the status summary."

> **Human:** "What project am I in now?"
> **Assistant:** "You're currently in the **content-manager** project."

> **Human:** "Rebuilding the site did the trick! Do I need to do this regularly, I wonder? Is this going to happen every time I release a backdated post?"
> **Assistant:** "Great that it worked! [...] This suggests it's a **sporadic Micro.blog caching/indexing issue** rather than a systematic problem with backdated posts."
