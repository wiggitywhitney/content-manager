### Summary - d3d6cd60

A new documentation file detailing the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a temporary post dating feature was added to the repository. The developer explored the issue of backdated posts not being recognized by social media syndication due to their posting dates being in the past. They proposed a two-phase posting strategy: initially posting with the current date to ensure social media visibility and then updating the post to its intended backdate after a day. 

During the discussions, the developer clarified how the system will identify the correct backdate using a date field in the spreadsheet, and confirmed that the posting script runs daily. They agreed that the script should still publish entries where the date in the spreadsheet matches today. The conversation also touched on the potential impact of URL slug changes when backdating posts, with assurance that existing regeneration logic would handle this effectively.

As the session progressed, they validated assumptions about the posting behavior, confirming the need for a test plan to ensure that posts created with today's date trigger syndication, while backdated posts do not. They outlined a straightforward approach for implementation, emphasizing the importance of simplicity and reliability in the process.

The session concluded with the successful creation of the PRD, which includes the user journey, success criteria, and technical approach for the feature, ensuring clarity in the implementation steps ahead. The developer felt prepared to move forward with the next stages of development.

### Development Dialogue - d3d6cd60

> **Human:** "Question one: there's a date field in the spreadsheet, and that will always be populated with the day that the event happened or the content got created, probably back in the past."
> **Assistant:** "[...] How will the system know what the 'correct' backdate should be? Is there a field in your content management system that stores the 'intended date' separate from the 'published date'?"

> **Human:** "I'm optimistic that the URL slug will end up okay. It might take three days, but I think it'll end up descriptive. Let's not fix the problem before it's a problem. We do have slug renaming regeneration logic already in the script. You can verify that if you want."

> **Human:** "Change to the proper date on the next daily sync. Keep it simple. Yes, script should publish if column D equals today. I don't see a problem with that. I think we're ready to make the PRD."

### Technical Decisions - d3d6cd60

- **DECISION: Implement Two-Phase Posting for Backdated Posts** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/18-temporary-post-dating.md
  - Current issue: Backdated posts don't trigger social media syndication.
  - Proposed solution: Two-phase posting strategy.
  - Phase 1: Post with today's date to trigger syndication.
  - Phase 2: Update post to intended backdate after 24+ hours.
  
- **DECISION: Use Existing Update Function for Backdating** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/18-temporary-post-dating.md
  - Decision to use `updateMicroblogPost()` instead of delete/recreate.
  - This preserves post identity and simplifies logic.
  
- **DECISION: Validate Assumptions Before Implementation** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/18-temporary-post-dating.md
  - Validate that posts created with today's date trigger syndication.
  - Ensure that updating a post's date does not re-trigger syndication.
  
- **DECISION: Keep Current Date Posting Logic** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/18-temporary-post-dating.md
  - Script should publish if Column D equals today.
  - This maintains simplicity in the posting process.
