I'd like to mark my LIVE spreadsheet as live. Add a row at the top to prominently warn user that any change to this spreadsheet is a change to whitneylee.com. Then I'll also keep an untracked "staging" spreadsheet for content that's not ready to be published

I'd also like to reevaluate whether the update-page-visibility action should run separately or as part of this overall `update` action

I may want to make a PRD around this, I'd like functionality where the posts auto-sort by date to make spreadsheet management easier. But it is turning out to be complex so I'm going to skip it for now
