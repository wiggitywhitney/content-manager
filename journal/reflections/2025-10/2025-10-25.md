I have an idea for a feature where I can put on future content and there is an "upcoming" category. There is a lot to think about here like what cross-posting looks like and what happens when the date passes (it would need to move categories) and how to boost if/when there is an actual link to the resource posted (which can happen after the date of the event, esp for conference talks). I will make a prd later just want to jot it down for now
