walking away from computer now but I want to add PRDs around two things: (1) git rid of (migrate?) my hachyderm(mastodon) and bluesky accounts and have micro.blog as single source of truth, and (2) when I add several lines of new content at once, add behavior that posts only one new piece of content per day (probably implement this once initial big sync is done, or maybe only for the last x months of recent content)
