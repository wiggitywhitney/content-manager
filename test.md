# Amazing Animals

## Platypuses

Platypuses are extraordinary creatures! They're one of only five species of monotremes (egg-laying mammals). They have duck bills, beaver tails, otter feet, and venomous spurs. They use electroreception to hunt underwater. Truly one of nature's most fascinating oddities!

## Octopuses

Octopuses are equally incredible! They have three hearts, blue blood, and can change color instantly. They're highly intelligent problem-solvers with distributed brains (neurons throughout their eight arms). They can squeeze through tiny spaces and are masters of camouflage. Absolutely remarkable creatures!
